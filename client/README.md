# Backend Server
This README.md will be used to illustrate the structure of the frontend client of the project.
## Structure
The frontend client uses simple React, along with Tailwind to apply styles. I decided to use TypeScript to better type needed props and database data. In the components folder (inside of src) one can found all the individual components, those being pages, cards or modals. In index.tsx, we have the basic routing and structure of the app.
