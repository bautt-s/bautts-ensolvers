# Notely - Ensolvers postulation 👨‍💻
Notely is my postulation for the job position of Trainee/Jr Web Dev at Ensolvers. It is made from all the requirements given, with the proper use of API routing and frontend management and styling.

## Usage 🚀
The users are greeted by a general screen as soon as they join the page, inviting them to check out the app main screen. In here, they can create new notes, or edit, delete or archive existing ones. They may also filter their notes by categories, or select between active or archived ones. Clicking on the note icon in a card will expand the note, in order to be able to read its contents. Importante to note that is a fully responsible app, so it can be used in mobile as well.

## Installation 🛠
In order to use this project locally, you can clone this repository in your machine, and run the batch script in the main directory: it will handle module installation and booting of both the client and server.

## Technologies 💻
For the backend server, I used Express.js 4.16.1, along with Prisma ORM 4.14.
For the frontend client, technologies used were React 18.2.6, React Icons 4.8, TypeScript 4.9.5 and Tailwind 3.3.2.
